# 🕵🏻‍♂️📷 FakeCheck: Deepfake Image Detection using Deep Learning Models

## 📜 Abstract
Deepfake technology has emerged as a major threat to digital security, making it essential to develop robust detection methods. This project explores the use of deep learning models for detecting deepfake images. We implement and evaluate three deep learning models—ResNet, InceptionNet, and MobileNet—to analyze their architectures and assess their ability to differentiate between real and synthetic media. The implementation includes three Jupyter notebooks and a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

## ✨ Features
- 🖼️ Implementation of ResNet, InceptionNet, and MobileNet for deepfake detection
- 🎯 Pre-trained models fine-tuned for high accuracy in identifying fake images
- 📒 Jupyter notebooks for in-depth analysis and experimentation
- 🖥️ GUI for user-friendly deepfake detection
- 📊 Dataset preprocessing and augmentation for improved model performance

## 🔍 Applications
- 🔎 Detecting synthetic or AI-generated images
- 🌐 Identifying manipulated media in social networks
- 🔐 Enhancing digital security and fraud prevention
- 📡 Research and development in AI-driven media authentication

## ⚙️ How to Run FakeCheck?

We have provided three notebooks for visualizing the results of the models. 

**For the GUI:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FakeCheck.git
   cd FakeCheck
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to test the models.

4. To launch the GUI, execute:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

## 🎯 Usage
- 📘 Open and run the provided Jupyter notebooks (`ResNet.ipynb`, `InceptionNet.ipynb`, `MobileNet.ipynb`) to train and test the models.
- 🖼️ Use the GUI to upload an image and get instant deepfake detection results.

## 🚀 Future Work
- 📈 Expanding the dataset to improve model generalization
- 🤖 Incorporating advanced deep learning models such as Vision Transformers
- 🎥 Real-time deepfake video detection
- 🌍 Web-based interface for accessibility
- 🛡️ Improved adversarial robustness against sophisticated deepfake attacks
